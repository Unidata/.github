## NSF Unidata Pause in Most Operations

Due to the current gap in continued funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the NSF Unidata Program Center has temporarily paused most operations. **As a result, activity from Unidata Program Center staff on this repository will cease until after the temporary pause.** See [NSF Unidata Pause in Most Operations](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/nsf-unidata-pause-in-most) for details.

## What is NSF Unidata?

U.S. National Science Foundation Unidata is a diverse community of education and research institutions with the common goal 
of sharing geoscience data and the tools to access and visualize that data. For more than 35 years, 
NSF Unidata has been providing data, software tools, and support to enhance Earth-system education 
and research. Funded primarily by the [U.S. National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov/), NSF Unidata is one of 
the [University Corporation for Atmospheric Research](https://www2.ucar.edu/) (UCAR)'s 
[Community Programs](https://www.ucar.edu/ucp) (UCP). 

NSF Unidata's GitHub repositories contain code for software projects created or maintained by
developers at the NSF Unidata Program Center. We actively encourage contributions to these projects
in the form of issues and pull requests.
