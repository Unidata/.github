## What is Unidata?

Unidata is a diverse community of education and research institutions with the common goal 
of sharing geoscience data and the tools to access and visualize that data. For more than 35 years, 
Unidata has been providing data, software tools, and support to enhance Earth-system education 
and research. Funded primarily by the [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov/) (NSF), Unidata is one of 
the [University Corporation for Atmospheric Research](https://www2.ucar.edu/) (UCAR)'s 
[Community Programs](https://www.ucar.edu/ucp) (UCP). 

Unidata's GitHub repositories contain code for software projects created or maintained by
developers at the Unidata Program Center. We actively encourage contributions to these projects
in the form of issues and pull requests.
